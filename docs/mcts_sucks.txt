initial implementation did about 50 iterations
super slow and was basically random
hugged the top
was weighted top left due to most early search moves having equal visits and weighting

improved speed by replacing recursive simulation with shuffled move list and iterating to fill the board
increased to 2000 iterations

still wasnt doing the best
optimised it by identifying the win checking taking too long
ran simple static analysis on all board rows to check if one is empty and could then skip the dfs
works until the board starts getting filled
